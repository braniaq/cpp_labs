//1. Start a program called Test_output.cpp. Declare an integer birth_year and assign it the year you were born.
//2. Output your birth_year in decimal, hexadecimal, and octal form.
//3. Label each value with the name of the base used.
//4. Did you line up your output in columns using the tab character? If not,
//do it.
//5. Now output your age.
//6. Was there a problem? What happened? Fix your output to decimal.
//7. Go back to 2 and cause your output to show the base for each output.
//8. Try reading as octal, hexadecimal, etc.:
//cin >> a >>oct >> b >> hex >> c >> d;
//cout << a << '\t'<< b << '\t'<< c << '\t'<< d << '\n' ;
//Run this code with the input
//1234 1234 1234 1234
//Explain the results.
//9. Write some code to print the number 1234567.89 three times, first using
//defaultfloat, then fixed, then scientific forms. Which output form pre-
//sents the user with the most accurate representation? Explain why.
//10. Make a simple table including last name, first name, telephone number, and email address for yourself and at least five of your friends. Experi- ment with different field widths until you are satisfied that the table is well
//presented.
