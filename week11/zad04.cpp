//Using hexadecimal literals, define short unsigned ints with:
//a. Every bit set
//b. The lowest (least significant bit) set
//c. The highest (most significant bit) set
//d. The lowest byte set
//e. The highest byte set
//f. Every second bit set (and the lowest bit 1)
//g. Every second bit set (and the lowest bit 0)

//Do 3 and 4 using bit manipulation operations (|, &, <<) and (only) the literals 1 and 0
